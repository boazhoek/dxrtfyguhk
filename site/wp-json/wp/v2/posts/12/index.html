At first glance they appear to be one and the same: if you were to create either a new page or a new post you&#8217;d be presented with nearly identical interfaces and in many cases the public appearance of pages and posts will look the same.<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t let this fool you. There&#8217;s a very fundamental difference between the two and that difference is what makes CMSs, like WordPress, great platforms for integrating blogs with traditional websites.<\/p>\n<h4>Pages<\/h4>\n<p>Think about the kind of pages that make up a typical website. Most often you&#8217;ll see pages like &#8220;Home&#8221;, &#8220;About Us&#8221;, &#8220;Services&#8221;, &#8220;Contact Us&#8221;, etc. Within WordPress these are often treated as <em><strong>Pages<\/strong><\/em>; documents that have no particular regard for the time they were posted.<\/p>\n<p>For example, when you visit the &#8220;About Us&#8221; page of your favorite company&#8217;s website you don&#8217;t expect the content to be very different from what was available there a week ago.<\/p>\n<p><!--more Read more > --><\/p>\n<h4>Posts<\/h4>\n<p>Now take a moment to think of your favorite news website. A news site is an ideal example of when you&#8217;d expect content to be different from the last time you visited &mdash; after all, news just wouldn&#8217;t be news if it weren&#8217;t current. In the case of news sites, <em><strong>Posts<\/strong><\/em> are most often used to write articles.<\/p>\n<p>When you publish a post within WordPress it knows to treat the post differently than the way it treats a page. For example, when you enable a blog within your BoldGrid theme, it will list all of your published posts in reverse chronological order on your <em><strong>Blog<\/strong><\/em> page.<\/p>\n<p>Your BoldGrid site can contain both pages and posts, i.e. you may have an &#8220;About Author&#8221; page to compliment your weekly blog. When done well, utilizing pages and posts in this way can help you build a more engaging experience for your visitors.<\/p>\n<p class=\"mod-reset\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Pages vs. Posts If you&#8217;re new to WordPress you may be wondering what&#8217;s the big deal behind Pages and Posts.
